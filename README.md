# crystal big data

A scalable crystal pattern recognition library

Main features:

* Based on the Many-Body Expansion(MBE) formula
* Written in C++(back-end), Python(front-end), and Bash/Shell
* Testing code written in Fortran for numerical tests

Roadmaps:
* A more complete NoSQL-type library for more recognition types
* A complete gradient-decent code(APIs) for crystal pattern dynamics
* Interface to MongoDB
